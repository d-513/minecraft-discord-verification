A discord bot and a minecraft skript to link your minecraft server's players discord accounts

# Instalation
1. Discord bot:

The bot is written in nodejs. That means you need a nodejs server to host it, but don't worry, if you don't want to buy it, i can show you how to get it for free

Guide on hosting the bot on a free server (the process is kinda different)

Guide on hosting the bot on your own nodejs server:
First, download the repository. (Click)[https://github.com/dada513/minecraft-discord-verification/archive/master.zip]
Extract it and get the `minecraft` folder.
Upload it to your node server
Open command line and make sure you are in the folder you uploaded
Type `npm i` to install all the required packages
To run it, simply type `npm start`. But for now, we need to configure it.
